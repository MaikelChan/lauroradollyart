Lovely choker, great material and such a cute charm! The seller included an extra charm in my order, which was so sweet, and just as beautiful! The only word of warning is that this was a gift for a friend, and the choker it just slightly too small to fit around their neck all the way. This is easily fixed with an added clasp to extend the length, so it&amp;rsquo;s no trouble, just something to note if you have a slightly bigger neck!</description></item><item><title>Arama Aranara figure</title><link>https://lauroradolly.art/posts/figure-arama-aranara/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Nov 2023 19:17:13 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://lauroradolly.art/posts/figure-arama-aranara/</guid><description>Arama Aranara figure
