I&amp;rsquo;m Lora. I&amp;rsquo;m a clay sculptor and traditional artist.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in sculpting and drawing for as long as I can remember. Since I was a kid I dreamed about being able to create tiny friends which could follow me in my adventures. I get inspiration from everything cute and magical. I&amp;rsquo;m also very fond of nature so I always try to find more eco-friendly and sustainable materials. Working with cold porcelain is one of my favorite ways for making that possible.</description></item></channel></rss>
