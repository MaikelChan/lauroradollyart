Lovely choker, great material and such a cute charm! The seller included an extra charm in my order, which was so sweet, and just as beautiful! The only word of warning is that this was a gift for a friend, and the choker it just slightly too small to fit around their neck all the way. This is easily fixed with an added clasp to extend the length, so it&amp;rsquo;s no trouble, just something to note if you have a slightly bigger neck!</description><content type="html"><![CDATA[
